# Developing a Multithreaded Kernel from Scratch

## About this Course

The course is divided into several main sections:

- **Real Mode Development**
- **Protected Mode Development**
- **Assembly Language Bonus**

Each section offers a unique perspective on kernel development and is designed to build your skills incrementally.

### Real Mode Development

This is your introduction to kernel development, here we cover:

- The boot process and how memory works
- Writing a boot loader in assembly language
- Working with interrupts in real mode
- Reading a sector (512 bytes) from the hard disk

### Protected Mode Development

Delve deep into the creation of a 32-bit multi-tasking kernel featuring:

- FAT16 filesystem implementation
- Memory management and virtualization techniques
- Keyboard driver implementation
- ELF file loader creation
- Design of a virtual filesystem layer (inspired by Linux kernel)
- Process and task functionality

### Assembly Language Bonus

If you struggle with assembly language, this bonus section aims to bring your skills up to speed.

## Instructor

This course is taught by an experienced instructor who has developed Linux kernel modules professionally.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of the C programming language
